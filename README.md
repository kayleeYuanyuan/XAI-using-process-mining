# XAI-using-process-mining
Research project

This repository contains the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI agent using the Minimax algorithm plays against a simulated human player using a random algorithm. The purpose of this project is to generate game event logs for process mining to explain AI behaviour. The repository includes the following components:

- Python code:
  - `Human-first.py`: Human (Random) plays first
  - `AI-first.py`: AI (Minimax) plays first
 
- CSV files:
  - `AI-firstPlayer.csv`: Event logs of 10,000 games where AI plays first
  - `Human-firstPlayer.csv`: Event logs of 10,000 games where human plays first
    
- Research paper:
   A comprehensive research paper that details the objectives, methodology, implementation, and findings of the project. The paper discusses how the game event logs can be 
   used to generate process models using process mining techniques to explain AI behaviour.
